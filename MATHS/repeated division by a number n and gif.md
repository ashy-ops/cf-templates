# Floor Division by 2 Sequence

At each step, you divide the previous value by 2 and take the floor. This sequence continues until:

a_t = 0

where t is the number of steps taken.

---

## 1. Stepwise Floor Division

a_(k+1) = floor(a_k / 2)

with initial value

a_0 = n

---

## 2. Direct Division by Powers of Two

Alternatively:

a_k = floor( n / (2^k) )

for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., until a_k = 0.

## 3. Number of Steps Before Reaching Zero

Number of steps t is:

t = floor(log2(n)) + 1

Explanation:

- The last nonzero term satisfies: n / 2^(t-1) >= 1
- The first zero term satisfies: n / 2^t < 1
- Taking log base 2: t > log2(n)
- Since t is integer: t = floor(log2(n)) + 1
- Also for some other number instead of 2 it will be floor(logb(n))+1

## 4. Example

For n = 20:

log2(20) â‰ˆ 4.32

Number of steps:

t = floor(4.32) + 1 = 5

Sequence:

20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
