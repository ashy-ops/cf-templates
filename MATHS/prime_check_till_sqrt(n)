any composite number can be represented as product of two numbers-
a*b
three cases-
a=b, in that case both are sqrt(n)
a<sqrt(n) and b<sqrt(n)- then that is not possible as the product will not go upto n
a>sqrt(n) and b<sqrt(n) in this case it is possible however it shows that one of the numbers must be less that sqrt(n)
