#Questions are doable.
#Look for patterns of numbers.
#if division involved make sure always that the divisor can never be 0 otherwise run time error throws.
#Make sure to think a little more creatively than being rigid for the problem.
#Try to think for the following thins-
1.) Binary Search,DFS,BFS,some pattern?,sortings,recurssion,bitmasks,brute force?

#Treat the problems creatively!
#Check the Parameters Size and things like sum of numbers over all test case should be less than this and then look at the time limit and then think of how complex you can make it?
maybe you can then brute force it? or maybe pherhaps O(n^2)?

#Maybe try to think in terms of binary bits?
